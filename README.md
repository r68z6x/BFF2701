Question   1Consider   a   Kyle   (1985)   model   set-up   in which the true value of the   stock   is   $75.00,   the   unconditional   variance of the true value is 8, the variance of uninformed trading is   15,000   and the   expected value   of   the stock   is $80.00 without   private   information.    That   is:
               F(̃)   =   $75.00
               σF(2)      =   8.00
               σZ(2)      =   15,000
               F(̅)   =   $80.00
(a)    Calculate the   informed   trader’s equilibrium trading demand   (x).      Report your   response   to   four   decimal   places.    Interpret   the   result.
(b)   Calculate   the   dealers’   price   sensitivity   in   equilibrium   (λ).       Report   your   response   to   four   decimal   places.    Interpret   the   result.
(c)   Calculate   the   informed   trader’s   expected   profit   in   equilibrium   (̃(π)).   Report   your   response   to four decimal   places.
(d)   Now, let us assume that the realised uninformed trading demand   is   500.    That   is, Z    =   500.   Let   us also assume that the   informed trader submits   the trading   demand   derived   in   Part   (a).
(i)                         Calculate the dealers’ price   if they follow their equilibrium strategy (p(w)).    Report   your   response to four decimal   places.
(ii)                      Calculate   the   informed   trader’s   realised   profit   (π).       Report   your   response to   four   decimal   places.
(iii)                   Calculate the dealers’   realised   profit   (πMM   ).    Report your   response   to   four   decimal   places.
(e)   Now,   let   us   assume   that   the   realised   uninformed   trading   demand   is   -200.      That   is,   z   =   −200.    Let   us also assume that the informed   trader   submits the trading   demand   derived   in   P代 写BFF2701 Equity Markets Tutorial 5 Questions

(iii)                Explain the difference in the informed trader’s profit from Part (d)(ii) to Part (e)(ii).
Question 2 (Teall   (2022) Q6.3)
The model of demand in the Kyle (1985) assumes that perfectly informed trader demand x increases linearly in his expected value of the traded stock. This assumption is important to Kyle's results. Demonstrate that perfectly informed trader demand x in the Kyle model increases linearly in the difference between his expected value of the traded stock and the price p set by the dealer. (This difference, v-po, is the profit per share to the informed trader.)   
Question 3 (Teall (2022)   Q6.4)
An informed trader has private information that the value of a stock is $100 per share. Without this information, the variance of payoffs on the stock would be $60; this is the level of payoff uncertainty faced by uninformed investors. The variance associated with uninformed investor trades is 10,000 shares.
a. If the value of the stock were to be $100 without the private information, what would be the level of informed trader demand for the stock?
b. If the value of the stock were to be $90 without the private information, what would be the level of informed trader demand for the stock?
c. What will be the informed trader's expected profits from purchasing the number of shares computed in part b?
d. Suppose that actual uninformed demand for the stock were zero. Based on your computations from part b, at what level would the dealer set the stock price?
